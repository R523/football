# Football

## Introduction

The **Football** project recreates the dynamic camera movements typically observed during live football broadcasts.
It utilizes a Raspberry Pi as the central control unit that interfaces with a servo motor responsible for camera rotation.
Users can interact through a dedicated web panel, designed to issue rotation commands. These commands trigger the Raspberry Pi to operate the servo motor via PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signaling.
PWM allows for precise control over the motor, ensuring smooth and accurate camera motion that emulates professional football match camera operations.
